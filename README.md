# Ulmaceae
The family classification above ulmus which is above elms.

# Rationale

ELMSLN is a network of systems. It will soon support fractal networks, let's consider these to be a forest. This forest could technically still be delivering the course experience for one college (many ELMSLN deployments working together for reasons of scale that give the student the impression of taking courses in a college).

What a distributed series of systems doesn't address is human's need for centrality. We need a system that can aggregate the vast universe of forests that are to be created. This is how universities can provide a place for students to go and find all the courses. This is also the place faculty can request a course be produced and have it correctly routed to the CIS deployment in charge of that course. It's also something we could ping LTI requests off of to spider them down to the correct location, providing a central point for legacy architectures to latch on to.

Ulmaceae will be for the routing of data, people, and course experiences tot he appropriate CIS. It is for managing multiple CISs across multiple colleges.

Android-esk fragmentation eventually leads to unification and better solutions; this will eventually be nessecary to achieve that end.
